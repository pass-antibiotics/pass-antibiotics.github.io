# Antimicrobial resistance

Antibiotic resistance, the process whereby bacteria evolve mechanisms to counteract 
  the effects of antibiotics, is a growing problem. We are already seeing a number of 
  bacterial infections that do not respond to antibiotics (so-called “superbugs”).  

Although there are still antibiotics that we can use against superbugs like MRSA, 
  they are often expensive and cause side effects. In the future we are likely to see 
  more bacteria like MRSA. Even more worrying, there are already reports of superbugs 
  that are completely untreatable with antibiotics.

PASS and Bug Watch bring together 
* researchers from a range of disciplines and 
* professionals from primary care, secondary care and care home. 

Together, we are working on new ways to promote ‘antimicrobial stewardship’, 
  that is to optimise the use of antibiotics 
  and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship gives 
  doctors a set of tools and practices to optimise the choice, dosing, duration and 
  administration of antibiotics so as to maximise benefits to patients and minimise 
  unintended consequences such as antimicrobial resistance. Dr Laura Shallcross, 
  one of the PASS study leads said:

> “The bottom line is that in order to slow down the development of antibiotic 
  resistance, we need to reduce the number of antibiotic prescriptions in the UK. 
  It sounds easy, but changing any behaviour is difficult, let alone a really complex 
  behaviour like antibiotic prescribing. Complex issues like this require us to think 
  differently about how we go about doing the research. With that in mind we have 
  put together a collaborative team with a range of backgrounds: data scientists, 
  health psychologists, social scientists, designers. Using their expertise we hope 
  to approach the problem from a variety of directions.”
