  Infections become drug-resistant when the bacteria that cause them adapt and change over time,
  developing the ability to resist the drugs designed to kill them. The result is that
  many drugs – like antibiotics – are becoming less effective at treating illnesses.
  Our overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals is speeding up this process.

## Antibiotics do not work as well as they used to

Antibiotics have transformed our ability to treat bacterial infections allowing us to live healthier, longer lives. But antibiotic overuse makes bacteria evolve so they can survive the effects of antibiotics. This is known as ‘antibiotic resistance’.


By 2050, 10 million people per year could die as a result of bacterial infections that cannot be treated with antibiotics. If we do nothing now we could face a future where the antibiotics that we take for granted today no longer work.  Without antibiotics we will not be able to treat common infections and procedures like chemotherapy, and hip-replacements that rely on antibiotics to prevent infections will become risky.

The year 2050 seems a long way off, but antibiotic resistant infections are affecting people now. It’s been estimated, for instance, that antibiotic resistance affected around [53 000 people in the UK in 2015, of which more than 2000 died](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(18)30605-4/fulltext).

These numbers can hide the fact that antibiotic resistance affects all sorts of people at a personal level. The vast majority of these people don’t die, but they may be sick for longer, need longer treatments or have more side-effects. You can read about how antibiotic resistance is affecting some of those people [here](https://antibiotic.ecdc.europa.eu/en/patient-stories).   

## So what is antibiotic resistance?


You’ll often see headlines about antibiotic resistance in the press. Most people will say that they know what antibiotic resistance is, but they often don’t get it right – it’s a slippery concept. Have a go at testing your understanding below:

<h3>Quiz</h3>

    <p>Below you’ll see some statements made by members of the public who were asked to describe what they understood by the term antibiotic resistance.</p>

    <p>Which do you think are correct?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you rely too much on antibiotics then your body gets used to them.</li>
        <li>If you take too much of anything then eventually you become immune to it.</li>
        <li>It’s your tolerance level. Your body has adapted to it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <details><summary>Answer</summary>
    <p><strong>All of these statements about antibiotic resistance are false.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Your body can become used to or tolerant to some drugs. Alcohol is a good example of this. If you drink regularly, your body will start to produce enzymes that break the alcohol molecules down quickly. The pint of beer that made you tipsy when you first started drinking, will have very little effect after you’ve been drinking for any length of time.
    </p>
    
    <p>Antibiotic resistance is not the same thing. It’s not your body that becomes resistant to the antibiotics it’s the bacteria themselves that become resistant to the antibiotics.
    </p>
    
    <p>It’s an important distinction. You can get an infection with an antibiotic resistant bacteria even if you have never had an antibiotic, for instance by picking it up from another person.</p>

Antibiotic resistance, then, is not the process whereby your body becomes tolerant to, gets used to or immune to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance refers to the process whereby bacteria become resistant to the antibiotics that we use to treat and prevent infections is they are no longer killed or prevented from reproducing by the antibiotics. 

## How do bacteria become resistant to antibiotics?

Your body is teeming with bacteria. Your gut, for instance, contains around 100 trillion bacteria. Most of these bacteria are harmless and may even be necessary for good health. There will be some bacteria as well that can cause disease but they will be competing for nutrients with all the other bacteria and will be kept in check. Antibiotics can upset that balance.

For instance, in your gut you’ll find a number of the bacteria called E.coli. This is completely normal. The bacteria will go about their own business and shouldn’t cause any problems. Every so often, however, bacteria will escape from the gut (in faeces), get into the bladder and cause a urine infection. If you have ever had a urine infection, you’ll know that it’s unpleasant, but will generally resolve by itself. For those infections that don’t resolve by themselves, antibiotic treatment will generally work.

Very occasionally, however, the genes in one of these E. coli living in your gut mutates. This mutation may allow the bacteria to survive treatment with antibiotics - it has developed antibiotic resistance. Imagine one of these antibiotic resistant bacteria in your gut. The chances are that it will never reproduce, or will be kept at very low levels through competition with other gut bacteria. However, if you take a course of antibiotics now you’ll suppress the competition and the E.coli bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic will be able to gain a foothold and multiply. If you get a urine infection with these bacteria now, the antibiotics are unlikely to work. You have an antibiotic resistant infection.

<h3>Urine infections: An example of infection commonly resistant to antibiotics today</h3>
<p>If you had a urine infection until very recently, the chances are your GP would have given you trimethoprim. First developed in 1962, it came onto the UK market in 1968 and was widely used as a treatment for urine infections caused by E coli (the most common cause of urine infections). The first record of E.coli that were resistant to trimethoprim in the UK was in 1972. By the 2010s 34% of E.coli urine infections were resistant to trimethoprim. Because of this GPs rarely use trimethoprim to treat urine infections now.</p>

## What factors lead to antibiotic resistance?

As you might expect one of the main reasons for the development of antibiotic resistance is the amount of antibiotics used. The greater the quantity of antibiotic used the, greater the likelihood of antibiotic resistance. This is supported by antibiotic data at a national level from a number of countries. Those in which lots of antibiotics are prescribed, also have high numbers of antibiotic resistant infections. 

This translates to the individual level. People who have previously had antibiotics are more likely to have an infection caused by an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. For instance, one study identified two groups of patients. The first group went to the GP with a urine-, or chest-infection that was caused by an antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the second group had a urine-, or chest-infection that was not antibiotic resistant. [Those in the first group were 4 times more likely to have had antibiotics in the past 2 months compared to those in the second group](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c2096).
