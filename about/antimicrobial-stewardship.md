Reading the news headlines, it can be easy to give up and not try to do anything about the problem of antibiotic resistance. But that is not the case, we can approach the problem from several angles:

## Preventing infections and their transmission

- Preventing an infection in the first place is an easy way to avoid using antibiotics, therefore avoiding the potential emergence of new antibiotic resistant bacteria
- Preventing a transmission of infections (particularly antibiotic-resistant ones) is also important. Most people will get an antibiotic resistant infection by picking up the resistant bacteria from the environment or another person. Good hygiene measures such as hand hygiene, clean safe water and proper food handling can block this chain of transmission.

## Developing new treatments

The obvious answer is to develop new antibiotics. As bacteria become resistant to the older antibiotics, introduce new antibiotics onto the market. This was the approach that was taken in the past. There are a couple of problems with this approach:

Firstly, we can predict that after time, bacteria will develop resistance and we’ll be back to square one. We can’t say how long it would take, but the first records of bacteria resistant to antibiotics were only a few years after the first antibiotics went on the market.

Secondly, there are significant barriers before an antibiotic can be put on the market. In particular, they are expensive to develop and profits for drug companies are lower than for other drugs.  In order to maximise profits a drug company needs to promote use, higher volume of use translates into profits, but there’s a problem here. Promoting the indiscriminate use of a new antibiotic will increase the chance of bacteria becoming resistant to it. Once this happens, the market for this antibiotic will dry up.

The last new antibiotic to come onto the market was in ???? and there are very few new antibiotics in the pipeline. In any case it takes such a long time for new antibiotics to come onto the market, we can’t rely on this as a solution in the short and medium term. 



## Reducing and improving antibiotic prescribing/antibiotic stewardship

We know that antibiotic resistant bacteria thrive when use of antibiotics is high, so reducing the number of antibiotics prescribed, reducing dose and duration is likely to be an effective approach. There are risks and benefits associated with this and the one of the difficult things for prescribers is to decide on the balance. Sometimes prescribers may be overcautious and one of the approaches to reducing prescribing may be to make the benefits of not prescribing outweigh the risks.

Work to achieve this is generally badged under the name of antibiotic stewardship which include a whole range of approaches. These include banning sales of over-the-counter antibiotics, introducing better diagnostic tools, developing prescribing guidelines, education campaigns for the general public, providing doctors with financial incentives to reduce prescribing, giving doctors feedback on their levels of prescribing. 

There are several examples of stewardship interventions that have been widely rolled out in the UK:
 
 - [TARGET](https://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/resources/toolkits/target-antibiotic-toolkit.aspx) is a toolkit which is aimed at GPs
 - [Start Smart Then Focus](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/antimicrobial-stewardship-start-smart-then-focus) is aimed at hospital
 - Antibiotic Guardian is a wider campaign aimed at promoting stewardship to health care workers and the general public. 
 
Antibiotic use has reduced by 9% overall in the UK between 2014 to 2018. The contribution of the above toolkits is not known with precisions. But we know that prescribing reduced in general and dental practice and increased in other community and hospital settings. This suggests more effort is still needed in parts of the health system.
