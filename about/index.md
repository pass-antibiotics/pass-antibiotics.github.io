   Antibiotic-resistant infections are a global threat. In healthcare,
   one solution to this problem lies in the 'stewardship' of antibiotics: 
   promoting the safe and effective use of antibiotics.

                <a href="/about/antibiotic-resistance"><h3>What is antibiotic resistance?</h3></a>
                <p>Bacteria that cause infections adapt and develop the ability to defeat the medicines
                    designed to kill them. </p>
                <p>Drugs like antibiotics are becoming less effective at treating infections.
                    Our overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals is speeding up this process.</p>

                <p>A range of strategies are used to tackle antibiotic resistance, 
                for instance developing new antibiotics, or reducing the use of 
                antibiotics in humans and animals.</p>
                <p>In healthcare, a strategy called <strong>antibiotic stewardship</strong>
                 aims to ensure effective treatment of patients with infection 
                while minimising adverse effects from antibiotic use.</p>

                 across primary care, secondary care, care homes and the community.</p>
                <p>Together we are working to design new interventions that are tailored to each 
                of these settings, and help to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for years to come.</p>
