                <h4>What is antibiotic resistance?</h4>
                <p>Bacteria that cause infections adapt and develop the ability to defeat the medicines
                    designed to kill them. </p>
                <p>Drugs like antibiotics are becoming less effective at treating infections.
                    Our overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals is speeding up this process.</p>

                <h4>What can we do about it?</h4>
                <p>Antimicrobial stewardship is a whole-of-society effort to keep antibiotics working 
                for years to come. It includes efforts to prevent infections and address overuse 
                of antibiotics in humans and animals.</p>

                <h4>The PASS project</h4>
                <p>PASS is a 3-year programme of research involving researchers and 
                doctors across England between 2017-2020.</p>
                <p>Together, they are working to design new interventions that help preserve the 
                effectiveness of antibiotics for years to come.</p>
