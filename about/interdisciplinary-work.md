Developing successful antibiotic stewardship interventions is difficult. Antibiotics are prescribed and used in a range of settings, a range of people are involved in decisions around antibiotic use and stewardship can involve a range of behaviours. As such, itâ€™s unlikely that researchers from one discipline will be able to come up with definitive answers. The PASS team is includes researchers from several academic disciplines: design, psychology, social science and epidemiology. The hope is that by combining the different insights and techniques that they use, we can come up with more effective interventions to improve antibiotic stewardship.
