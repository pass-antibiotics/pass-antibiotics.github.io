The PASS research team received funding from the Economic & Social Research Council to carry out a programme of research into antimicrobial stewardship. The aim of the research is to design antibiotic stewardship interventions that can be rolled out and tested in a range of settings. 

Hundreds of initiatives to improve appropriate use of antibiotics have been put into practice across a range of healthcare settings. Yet, they are not always successful or have only a small effect. We still have a limited understanding of why some interventions work and others fail. In particular, we do not always understand how human factors determine the success of interventions. Because of this, we need the contribution of social sciences to learn more about how to 

The work will be carried out in GP practices, a teaching hospital, care-homes and with members of the public and is split into three work-packages.

## Work package 1: Identifying patterns of antibiotic prescribing

Data on antibiotic prescribing in England is poor. We know remarkably little about who gets antibiotics, what for and for how long. Using pre-existing electronic health records, we will study data on antibiotic prescribing. We will also carry out an online survey, (the Bug Watch survey) that will give us data on why and when members of the public consult a doctor. This information will help us identify where problems lie and where intervening may have the greatest effect. 

## Work package 2: Identifying barriers and enablers to stewardship in context 

In order to identify what influences antibiotic prescribing, we will carry out interviews with health-care workers and members of the public. We will also carry out observations in GP practices, hospitals and care homes to see what happens in practice. Finally we will carry out a systematic search of the research to identify stewardship interventions that were or were not successful. This will allow us to identify the “active ingredients” of successful interventions. 

## Work package 3: Co-production of intervention bundles and dissemination

Co-production, involving consumers in the design of a product is commonly used in industry. There is evidence that this leads to better quality and acceptability of the end-product. Using our findings from the first two work-packages will work with members of the public and healthcare workers to develop antibiotic stewardship interventions bundles. We will use more structured-approaches commonly used by psychologists alongside more creative approaches used by designers to assess the potential of the interventions for testing in the field.
