            <p>Susan Michie is Professor of Health Psychology and Director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at UCL. Susan's research focuses on the design, delivery, uptake and impact of behaviour change interventions. Her research investigating innovative methods for developing and evaluating behavioural interventions is conducted in two main health domains: professional practice (e.g., the implementation of evidence-based guidelines, such as hand-hygiene amongst hospital staff), and risk factors amongst the general population (e.g., smoking, physical activity, preparing for pandemic flu). She works with a wide range of disciplines, practitioners and policy-makers and holds grants from a large number of organisations including the Wellcome Trust, National Institute of Health Research, Economic and Social Research Council and Cancer Research UK.</p>
