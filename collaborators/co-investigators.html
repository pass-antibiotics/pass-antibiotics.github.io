            <p>Anne is the interim Director of Health and Biomedical Surveys team within NatCen's Survey Research
                Centre.
                She leads a team of researchers who are responsible for delivering a range of biomedical social surveys
                including the Health Survey for England (HSE), the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) and the
                National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal).</p>
            <p>Anne specialises in the delivery of complex, large-scale social surveys with particular expertise in
                bio-social
                data collection methods. She has experience directing and managing a range of quantitative studies,
                including the Health Survey for England, the Millennium Cohort Study and Understanding Society.</p>
            <p>Anne led the recruitment of the Bug Watch, which involved inviting over 19,000 adults to participate in
                the study.
                These individuals had previously taken part in the Health Survey for England (a
                nationally-representative survey)
                and had provided consent to be contacted about future studies.</p>
