                which
                optimise prescribing and reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance. This project is aligned with the
                PASS

            <p>Prior to starting her PhD, Selina won an award for the most outstanding performance in her BSc at the
                University of Birmingham and completed her MSc at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

            <p>Emma Richardson is a Research Fellow in Forensic Linguistics at the Aston Institute for Forensic
                Linguistics, Aston University.
                She is a qualitative researcher with interests in how policy and guidance documents are used by people
                in practice,
                to assist the most vulnerable in society.</p>
            <p>Emma’s research activity is largely based within forensic and health and social care settings.
                She spent 4 years, first at the University of Liverpool and then at the University of Manchester
                examining the impact of
                the Care Quality Commission’s (CQC) inspection and rating of health and social care services in England
                before joining the
                PASS team at the University of Leicester as an ethnographer.</p>
            <p>Now based at Aston, she uses conversation analysis to examine investigative interviews with vulnerable
                adults.</p>

            <p>Rosanna is a designer, illustrator and researcher passionate about the affordances of user-led design and
                considerate information design. She is currently a Research Associate in the
                <a href="https://www.rca.ac.uk/research-innovation/research-centres/helen-hamlyn-centre/research_lab/healthcare_research_space/">
                    Healthcare Research Space</a> at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design at the Royal College of Art. She
                completed her BA in printmaking at
                Sheffield Hallam University, an MA in Communication Art & Design at the RCA in 2007, and a doctorate in
                Information Design at Reading University in 2017. The thesis explored the design and transparency of
                documents
                that record and relay past live art works, and the challenges and opportunities of relaying transient
                experience in print.
                Recommendations were presented through a working prototype, the structure and design of which was guided
                both by
                user-centred design and research methods and information design principles and practices.</p>
            <p>Her role as research associate at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design continues to further her interest
                and
                exploration into design research methods, which is core to the PASS design work package activities.</p>
