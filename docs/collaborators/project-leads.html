                research focuses on the
                application of data science (epidemiological analysis, risk prediction modelling, machine learning) to
                large-scale datasets
                such as electronic health records to improve clinical outcomes of patients with infectious diseases and
                improve antimicrobial
                prescribing.</p>
            <p>Laura's research has a strong translational focus. She works with a wide range of disciplines ranging
                from basic scientists (omics)
                to behavioural scientists, and collaborates with practitioners and policy-makers. She is a member of the

            <p>Doctor Fabiana Lorencatto is the Research Lead at the Centre for Behaviour Change at UCL. Fabiana's
                research interests
                are in behaviour change and implementation science. Her research focuses on applying behavioral change
                theory and
                methods to explore factors influencing clinical practice behaviors, as a basis for designing
                interventions to improve the quality of healthcare. </p>
            <p>Fabiana is currently involved in a number of multidisciplinary programs of research focusing on improving
                the
                implementation of evidence-based practice across a range of clinical areas, including: blood
                transfusion,
                antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention control, maternal and neonatal health, smoking
                cessation,
                and diabetic retinopathy screening. Fabiana also has specific methodological interests in synthesising
                evidence
                on behaviour change interventions and conducting process evaluations of complex interventions,
                particularly
                the assessment of intervention fidelity.</p>

            <p>Jonathan leads the Healthcare Research Space at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design at the Royal College
                of Art.
                His work on a new resuscitation trolley for the National Patient Safety Agency won two Medical Futures
                Innovation
                Awards and completed successful clinical trials prior to manufacture. He has shaped high profile
                projects such as
                Design Bugs Out and Design for Patient Dignity with the Department of Health and Design Council, as well
                as
                supervising projects with partners ranging from ArjoHuntleigh to the Medical Defence Union.
                He was Design Lead on the EPSRC-funded project 'Designing Out Medical Error'. This award-winning project
                pioneered
                methods of collaboration and has resulted in a suite of designs for the hospital ward, and paved the way
                for
                the HELIX Centre, where Jonathan was seconded. His work has been published internationally in journals,
                books and as papers.</p>
