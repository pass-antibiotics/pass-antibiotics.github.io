## A cohort study of infection symptoms

Bug Watch is a cohort of community households recording symptoms, severity, and use of antimicrobials in the population of England. 

Bug Watch tells us about symptoms of infection in the community before people go to see their doctor or pharmacist. It means we can find out about the severity and duration of symptoms from the start of an episode of infection. It also enables researchers to investigate differences between people who proceed to go to the doctor and those who do not.

In total, 1,242 adults and children registered between March and November 2018, with a total follow up time of 23,111 person-weeks. Participants in Bug Watch were asked to keep a weekly diary of common symptoms of infection like cough, sour throat, burning in peeing etc. They completed the survey for a total duration of six months.

## What is already known on the subject?

- Most antibiotics are prescribed in primary care, and at least 23% of prescriptions are thought to be inappropriate.
- One way to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in primary care is to encourage fewer the people to visit their GP when they have symptoms of infection.
- Previous studies have shown that most people safely self-manage symptoms of respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections. This is known as a clinical “iceberg” of infection. 
- There is little information on how people manage other symptoms of infection, or what other sources of information people use to get advice about their symptoms.

## What questions did we ask?

- What is the incidence of common acute infections in the general population in England? We looked at symptoms of respiratory tract, gastrointestinal, urinary tract, skin/soft tissue, mouth/dental, and eye infections. 
- What are the most commonly used sources of healthcare advice for different symptoms of infection?
- What proportion of people with symptoms of infection use an antibiotic?

## What did we find?
- There is a large clinical iceberg of infection across all symptom categories. Most people manage symptoms of infection without seeking medical advice.
- Overall, 1 in 10 infections led to a GP consultation and 1 in 8 to antibiotic use.
- People most frequently consulted a GP (or dentist) about their symptoms but a variety of other sources including pharmacies and the internet were also used frequently.
- A considerable proportion of people went to hospital for their symptoms (particularly for urinary tract infection syndromes)
- The NHS 111 service was not used often. 
- Most antibiotics were prescribed by GPs but hospital doctors were also an important source.
- Half of the antibiotics used were prescribed within three days of the onset of symptoms. 
- Delayed (or “standby”) prescriptions were used infrequently.
