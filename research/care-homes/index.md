title: Care homes
description: >
  Care homes have a strong focus on preventing and controlling infections, 
  but their antimicrobial stewardship efforts are less developed, compared to 
  to other healthcare settings. Care homes are thus a strategic care setting 
  for researchers to work on optimising antibiotic use.

## What is already known on the subject?

- Around one in seven people aged over 85 years live in approximately 20,000 care homes in the UK.
- Infections are common in care homes and can often lead to outbreaks. Antibiotics are therefore used frequently and there is potential for development of antibiotic resistance.
- Care home residents are particularly susceptible to side effects of antibiotics. They are also often admitted to hospital and move back to care homes, which can lead to spread of antibiotic resistant infections between these two settings.
- To safely reduce antibiotic use in care homes, better information is needed on how antibiotics are currently used in this setting.

## What questions did we ask?

### Electronic health records

- What is the rate of antibiotic prescribing for care home residents in the UK?
- How does prescribing vary by resident and care home characteristics?
- What infections are antibiotics most used for, and how does the type of antibiotic used compare with guidelines?


### Interviews

The aim of the interviews was to understand who performs antibiotic stewardship and when and how it is managed in care homes. The interview questions were developed using a theoretical informed behaviour change framework (Atkins et al [2017](#Atkins2017)) to identify the likely enablers and barriers of antibiotic stewardship (e.g. escalation of suspected infections within and beyond the care home). Recruitment was through a national care home provider using their prescribing data to include both ‘high prescribers’ and ‘low prescribers’ of antibiotics in the interviews. Interviews were conducted with managers, nurses and care assistants in 4 care homes in the Midlands and the South-East of England.


### Observations 

An ethnographer conducted direct non-participant observations in communal areas of the practice and consultations within 4 care homes, totalling 51 hours of observation. The care homes were selected from a list of provided by our partner Four Seasons Healthcare in two regions (East Midlands and London).
 
The researcher recorded detailed hand written field notes while at the research site. The researcher reflected on these notes and audio recorded the field notes, reflections and interpretations. These audio recordings were then transcribed and analysed alongside pictures and policies/guidelines collected from the research site.

Data were analysed using a qualitative data analysis software by coding contextual determinants of healthcare improvement. This was based on a framework of six universal challenges to improving quality commonly faced by healthcare organisation and identified by Bate, Mendel and Robert [(2008)](#Bate2018).

## What did we find?

### Electronic health records

- The rate of antibiotic prescribing for care home residents was about twice the rate for older adults in the general population.
- Residents who had recently moved into the care home, were nearer to the end of life, and had more long-term medical conditions were most likely to be prescribed antibiotics.
- Almost a third of antibiotics were repeat prescriptions, likely for prevention of infection. 
- Urinary tract infections and chest infections led to the most antibiotic prescriptions. Most of the time, the type of prescription was in line with guidelines for treatment of infections in primary care. However, there are no care home-specific guidelines for antibiotic prescription.
- There was wide variation in the rate of antibiotic prescriptions in different care homes. More research is needed to understand what causes this variation.
