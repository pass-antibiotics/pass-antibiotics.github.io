In comparison with the other healthcare settings considered in PASS, antimicrobial stewardship programmes are less developed in care homes, which tend to have a stronger focus on preventing and controlling infections. Care homes thus represent an important setting for research to optimise antibiotic use.

## What is already known on the subject?

- Around one in seven people aged over 85 years live in approximately 20,000 care homes in the UK.
- Infections are common in care homes and can often lead to outbreaks. Antibiotics are therefore used frequently and there is potential for development of antibiotic resistance.
- Care home residents are particularly susceptible to side effects of antibiotics. They are also often admitted to hospital and move back to care homes, which can lead to spread of antibiotic resistant infections between these two settings.
- To safely reduce antibiotic use in care homes, better information is needed on how antibiotics are currently used in this setting.

## What questions did we ask?

### Electronic health records

- What is the rate of antibiotic prescribing for care home residents in the UK?
- How does prescribing vary by resident and care home characteristics?
- What infections are antibiotics most used for, and how does the type of antibiotic used compare with guidelines?


### Interviews


### Observations 

An ethnographer conducted non-participant observation at a large teaching hospital in Birmingham, UK. Four consultant teams were drawn at random from hospital databases based on their record of prescribing. The researcher observed a total of four wards during a total of 123 hours.

The researcher recorded detailed hand written field notes while at the research site. The researcher reflected on these notes and audio recorded the field notes, reflections and interpretations. These audio recordings were then transcribed and analysed alongside pictures and policies/guidelines collected from the research site.

Data were analysed using a qualitative data analysis software by coding contextual determinants of healthcare improvement. This was based on a framework of six universal challenges to improving quality commonly faced by healthcare organisation and identified by Bate, Mendel and Robert [(2008)](#Bate2018).

## What did we find?

### Electronic health records

- The rate of antibiotic prescribing for care home residents was about twice the rate for older adults in the general population.
- Residents who had recently moved into the care home, were nearer to the end of life, and had more long-term medical conditions were most likely to be prescribed antibiotics.
- Almost a third of antibiotics were repeat prescriptions, likely for prevention of infection. 
- Urinary tract infections and chest infections led to the most antibiotic prescriptions. Most of the time, the type of prescription was in line with guidelines for treatment of infections in primary care. However, there are no care home-specific guidelines for antibiotic prescription.
- There was wide variation in the rate of antibiotic prescriptions in different care homes. More research is needed to understand what causes this variation.
