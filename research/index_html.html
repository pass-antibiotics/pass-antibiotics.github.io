    Alongside a meta-analysis of antimicrobial stewardship reviews in hospitals,
    we have partnered up with Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK, to conduct
    primary research. This includes:
    <ul>
        <li>ethnographic observations on general medical wards,</li>
        <li>interviews with clinicians,</li>
        <li>analysis of electronic records of prescribing and test results,</li>
        <li>engagement with stakeholders on the design and development of future intervention bundles.</li>
