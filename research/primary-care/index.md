  Primary care is often the first point of consultation for patients who show signs of infection. Consequently, three out of four of antibiotics in the UK are prescribed by general practitioners (GPs). Reducing antibiotic prescribing in this setting can have a major impact on the total amount of antibiotics prescribed and may significantly reduce the population-wide exposure to antibiotics. Since they continuously manage their patients’ health conditions, GPs are also best placed to judge their patients’ need for antibiotic treatment. However, in order to do so effectively, GPs rely on the latest research and tools to deal with diagnostic uncertainty and operate in an environment in which both physicians and patients feel safe to withhold or delay antibiotic treatment when it isn’t needed.

## The role of general practitioners

Primary care is often the first point of consultation for patients who show signs of infection. Consequently, three out of four of antibiotics in the UK are prescribed by general practitioners (GPs). Reducing antibiotic prescribing in this setting can have a major impact on the total amount of antibiotics prescribed and may significantly reduce the population-wide exposure to antibiotics. 

Since they continuously manage their patients’ health conditions, GPs are also best placed to judge their patients’ need for antibiotic treatment. However, in order to do so effectively, GPs rely on the latest research and tools to deal with diagnostic uncertainty and operate in an environment in which both physicians and patients feel safe to withhold or delay antibiotic treatment when it is not needed.

 
## What is already known on the subject?

- In England, more than three-quarters of antibiotics are prescribed in primary care with one-third of patients receiving at least one antibiotic prescription annually ([Dolk et al. 2018](#Dolk2018))
- Almost half this prescribing (46%) is targeted at respiratory tract infections, many of which tend to be self-limiting and are likely to improve in the absence of antibiotic treatment ([Dolk et al. 2018](#Dolk2018))
- Other common reasons for antibiotic prescribing in primary care are urinary tract infections (23%) and skin and soft tissue infections (14%) ([Dolk et al. 2018](#Dolk2018))
- There is substantial variation in the use of antibiotics between GP practices, with some prescribing at twice the rate than others even after accounting for the severity of the patient’s illnesses ([Stuart et al. 2020](#Stuart2020))
- Ascertaining the appropriateness of prescribing decisions in primary care is difficult but researchers agree that a substantial proportion of prescribing is inappropriate, with estimates ranging from 8%-23% (Smith et al. , JAC)
- The prescribed duration of therapy also often exceeds the recommended length of treatment stated in national guidance ([Pouwels et al. 2019](#Pouwels2019))
- The use of antibiotics is particularly high in young children and the elderly, which are commonly perceived at an increased risk of complications and thus treated conservatively ([Dolk et al. 2018](#Dolk2018))
- Comorbid patients are another patient group that receives a disproportionate amount of antibiotics in primary care, leading to a situation in which more than 50% of all primary-care antibiotics are concentrated in only 10% of patients ([Shallcross et al. 2017](#Shallcross2017))
- Antibiotic prescribing rates have been declining in English primary care since 2014, possibly due to increased antibiotic stewardship measures ([Public Health England 2019](#ESPAUR2019)).
- Most existing interventions target prescribing for self-limiting infections in otherwise healthy populations and little evidence exists on how to optimise prescribing in vulnerable patients at the highest risk of resistant infections


## What questions did we ask?
- What is the rate of antibiotic prescribing in healthy patients compared to patients perceived at a high risk of infection (e.g. elderly patients, or patients with lung disease)?
- What are the drivers of antibiotic prescribing in those patient groups with particularly high antibiotic prescribing rates?
- Are patients that do not receive immediate antibiotic prescribing at higher risk of negative outcomes?

## What did we find?

- Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) are among the most highly prescribed patients and account for 11.5% of all antibiotics handed out in primary care although they make up only 2.6% of the population 
- Antibiotic prescribing is elevated by ~60% even in patients with the mildest form of COPD compared to similar patients without COPD
- Patients with mild to moderate COPD might offer an ideal target for interventions such as delayed antibiotic prescribing, as they experience few exacerbations and have a low risk of hospital admission but are nevertheless on average prescribed between one and three antibiotics per year
- Patients with other comorbidities linked to an increased risk of infection (e.g. asthma, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease) all tend to receive increased numbers of antibiotic prescriptions
- Antibiotic prescribing for most comorbidities was already high one year before the formal diagnosis of the comorbidity in primary care, and remained 20-50% percent higher one year after diagnosis with increases temporally correlated with the date of diagnosis
- Antibiotic prescribing for asthma, COPD, diabetes and heart failure increased particularly dramatically in the months immediately prior to the initial diagnosis of comorbidity, potentially due to misdiagnosis of symptoms as respiratory infections
- Careful reanalysis of the risk of sepsis in elderly patients not immediately treated with antibiotics in primary care for suspected urinary tract infection did not find a previously reported higher risk of sepsis linked to delayed/non-prescribing
- The conflicting results highlight the difficulty of estimating reliable treatment effects from routine health data, as patients with and without treatment often tend to differ in many aspects not well recorded in the data (e.g. severity of disease)
