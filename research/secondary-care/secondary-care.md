  Antimicrobial stewardship in hospitals aim to optimise the use of antibiotics.
   This includes: making sure that antibiotics are only given to patients who 
   really need them, choosing the most effective antibiotic, and 
   prescribing the correct dose. This helps preserve the 
   effectiveness of antibiotics are preserved for years to come.

# Stewardship in hospitals 

The objectives of antimicrobial stewardship programmes are to work collaboratively to preserve the effectiveness 
of antibiotics by:

- preventing infections
- optimising prescribing decisions using better diagnostics and epidemiological expertise
- promoting good practice in the management of infections.

A range of clinical guidelines are now available from various agencies which set out good practice and the latest 
evidence on hospital antimicrobial stewardship (see [Guidelines & toolkits](#guidelines--toolkits) section).

# What we already know

## Use of antimicrobials in UK hospitals

In the UK, hospitals are responsible for 20% of the total amount of antibiotics prescribed in humans. Compared with other healthcare environments, hospitals prescribe more broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are the drugs used for the most severe infections. Hospitals can also play an important role in transmitting infections to other settings such as the community, for example when an individual with an active infection is discharged to a care home.

There are signs that antibiotics are being overused in hospitals:

- UK hospitals have the second highest prescribing rate out of 22 European nations in number of doses per 1,000 resident ([ECDC 2017](#ECDC-TESSy2017))
- A survey of UK hospitals recently estimated that 17% days of therapy are avoidable ([Public Health England 2015](#PHE2015))
- A study in Oxford compared antibiotic use between general medical physicians and infection disease physicians, who are specialists in treating infections. The study found that infectious disease physicians used 30% less days of therapy ([Fawcett et al. 2016](#Fawcett2016))

Worryingly, prescribing of the 'last resort' antibiotics (reserved for infections resistant to multiple drugs or patients with a compromised immune system) has increased by 28% between 2011 and 2016 ([Budd et al. 2019](#Budd2019)). These are mostly carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. 

Data show strong variation in the type of antibiotics used across hospitals. Specialist (eg cardiothoracic, haematology/oncology, paediatric  monospecialities) and teaching hospitals relied on large amounts of last-resort antibiotics.

## Effectiveness of stewardship interventions

Stewardship interventions in inpatient care settings are safe and effective in both: improving clinical practice, 
and reducing antimicrobial resistance. 
{:.lead}

The [most up-to-date and trusted systematic review](#Davey2017) of all evaluations published to date was released 
in 2017 in the Cochrane Library. Authors reviewed a total of 29 randomised controlled trials and 91 interrupted 
time series, and concluded that, overall, stewardship interventions are effective in relation to several outcomes:

- **compliance with clinical guidelines:** with intervention, 58% of patients were treated in accordance with antimicrobial guidelines, compared with 43% in a control group with no intervention
- **duration of antimicrobial therapy** was on average 2 days shorter with intervention
- **length of hospital stay** is an average 1 day shorter with intervention.

Authors also found no evidence that stewardship interventions increased mortality or other risks to patient safety.

A recent meta-analysis also provides some evidence that stewardship interventions reduce the prevalence of drug-resistant infections and transmission of drug-resistant bacteria. Baur et al. ([2017](#Baur2017)).


## Implementation of stewardship interventions globally

Globally, antimicrobial stewardship programmes are now established in most hospitals in high-income countries. 

Howard et al. ([2015](#Howard2015)) surveyed 660 hospitals across a total of 67 countries. Fifty-eight percent of hospitals had a dedicated antimicrobial stewardship committee in place, with the highest proportion in North America and Europe (66%) and a very low proportion in Africa (14%). This proportion ranged between 5 and 16% on other continents. 

Worldwide, 62% of hospitals reported having local stewardship guidelines.

The survey revealed that antimicrobial stewardship programmes can be very demanding on health professionals’ time, skills and confidence, particularly when it comes to reviewing antibiotic prescriptions ([Chung et al. 2013](#Chung2013)).

## Implementation of stewardship interventions in the UK

    <figcaption>Stewardship in secondary care: Common initiatives</figcaption>
</figure>


Scobie et al. ([2019](#Scobie2019)) surveyed stewardship initiatives across 148 NHS acute trusts in England in 2017. They found that 
<ul>
    <li><strong>85% restricted the use of some antibiotics</strong>, requiring a senior infection doctor or pharmacist to pre-authorise their prescription</li>
    <li><strong>93% had dedicated a dedicated antimicrobial stewardship team</strong>, including at least an antimicrobial pharmacist and a microbiology/infectious diseases doctor</li>
    <li><strong>99% had hospital prescribing guidelines</strong> for common infections</li>
    <li><strong>82% organised an expert review of prescriptions for specific antibiotics</strong>, with microbiology/infectious disease specialists or pharmacists giving feedback and advice to prescribers.</li>
</ul>

Half of hospitals (73/148) had a microbiologist conduct routine and regular ward rounds to review antibiotics at least once a week; 23% (34/148) did so every day (weekends included). The most commonly audited area was intensive care units (146/148), followed by medical wards (64%), surgical wards (60%) and haematology wards (58%).

Almost all hospitals were able to measure antimicrobial consumption, but only 31% (46/148) of surveyed hospitals regularly fed this information back to prescribers.


## Antibiotic prescription reviews

Antibiotic prescription reviews or ‘prospective audits’ involve the review of antibiotic prescriptions on wards by infection specialists, usually either an infectious diseases physician, a clinical microbiologist, or a clinical pharmacist. They are frequently described as the most effective strategy to optimise prescribing ([Chung et al. 2013](#Chung2013)).

Advantages of antibiotic prescription reviews are:

- they are more supportive and therefore better received by doctors than pre-authorisation of antibiotics. 
- they usually take places at the bedside (rather than over the telephone, when infection specialists cannot fully assess the patient); 
- they provides an opportunity for doctors to learn more about infections.

Disadvantages of antibiotic prescription reviews are:
-	They are time-consuming
-	They require up-to-date lists of patients taking antibiotics
-	Their reach can be limited by person-power: the median number of occupied beds in an English acute trust is 500. Out of those, 175 are occupied by patients taking antibiotics at any time. The median number of infection specialist is just 5 working time equivalents, occupied with many other duties.
-	Some areas of clinical practice are not supported by strong scientific evidence and guidelines. For instance, experts do not know for sure when and how antibiotics should be ‘de-escalated’; that is, how soon antibiotics can safely be stopped or changed for another drug with a narrower spectrum ([Hughes et al. 2017](#Hughes2017), [Tabah et al. 2019](#Tabah2019)).

# What questions did we ask?

## Review of published evidence

Although systematic reviews of stewardship interventions are available (see [above](#effectiveness-of-stewardship-interventions)), there is wide variation in the effectiveness of similar interventions across different settings. If we want to know which interventions are most likely to be effective, we need to know why they work.

In other words, we need to understand what are the 'active ingredients' of effective stewardship interventions. 

Behavioural science can be used to specify the 'active ingredients' of behavioural interventions, by coding them as [behaviour change techniques (BCTs)](https://digitalwellbeing.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BCTTv1_PDF_version.pdf){:target="_blank"}. To this end, health psychologists from PASS read through all 221 behavioural interventions reported in the systematic review by Davey et al. ([2017](#Davey2017)). They coded for the presence of <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s and then assessed how often effective interventions included specific types of <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s.  This provides evidence about the types of <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s that should be included in future stewardship interventions.

## Electronic health records

As  of June 2019, over half of acute NHS Trusts operated an electronic prescribing and administration system, but these 
systems do not currently play a major role in stewardship programmes. We aimed to test whether and how electronic 
records of prescriptions, microbial samples, and patient investigations (blood counts, vital signs) could be used to 
identify where antimicrobial use could be optimised.

Our study partner, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, provided the study team with anonymised patient records for adults who were admitted to hospital between 2008 and 2018. Researchers at University College London developed a range of software tools to visualise and analyse the data. The picture below shows a view from a prototype app used to compare compliance of antibiotic prescribing against the hospital’s stewardship guidelines.

## Interviews of prescribers

The aim of the interviews was to understand who performs antibiotic reviews, as well as when and how decisions to switch from intravenous to oral therapy and to stop antibiotics are made as part of antibiotic stewardship. The interview questions were developed using a theoretical informed behaviour change framework to identify the likely enablers and barriers of conducting reviews of antibiotics and switching or stopping antibiotic prescriptions (Atkins et al [2017](#Atkins2017)). Interviews took place in an NHS Foundation Trust hospital in England within low and high prescribing wards. Interviews were conducted with consultants, registrars, junior doctors and pharmacists across 4 specialist wards.

## Observations

An ethnographer conducted non-participant observation at an NHS Foundation Trust hospital in England. Four consultant teams were drawn at random from hospital databases based on their record of prescribing. The researcher observed a total of four wards during a total of 123 hours.

The researcher recorded detailed hand written field notes while at the research site. The researcher reflected on these notes and audio recorded the field notes, reflections and interpretations. These audio recordings were then transcribed and analysed alongside pictures and policies/guidelines collected from the research site.

Data were analysed using a qualitative data analysis software by coding contextual determinants of healthcare improvement. This was based on a framework of six universal challenges to improving quality commonly faced by healthcare organisation and identified by Bate, Mendel and Robert [(2008)](#Bate2018).

# What did we find?

## Review of published evidence

Interventions delivered in hospital inpatient settings employed 29 out of a total of [93 behaviour change techniques](https://digitalwellbeing.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BCTTv1_PDF_version.pdf){:target="_blank"} (<abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s), highlighting that many <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s are not used at all. 

The average number of <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s in each intervention was 4.5, 
showing that interventions are designed as a complex combination of techniques. 

The five most common <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s were:

{% include_relative bct_cards_html.html %}
 
However, when analysing the effect of individual <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s on intervention 
effectiveness, the statistical analysis only detected one interaction: interventions with <abbr title="behaviour change 
technique">BCT</abbr> *(1.2) Problem solving* were more effective than other interventions. Problem solving consists 
in analysing, or prompting the person to analyse, factors influencing their prescribing and bringing forward strategies 
to overcome barriers to improve prescribing. 

<!--
## Electronic health records
We found that 
There is a delay in adopting new guidelines - for instance the pneumonia switch to amox rather than co-amox is not implemented by X% of teams two years after.
Can we see an effect in the change of coamox?

# Bringing it all together
We are currently working to synthesize what we have learnt and develop behaviour change interventions. This involves

- reviewing barriers and facilitators of stewardship
- identifying mechanisms of change and behaviour change techniques
- collaborating with practitioners to decide how best to deliver behaviour change techniques in terms of feasibility and acceptability.
