# Stewardship in hospitals 

The objectives of antimicrobial stewardship programmes are to work collaboratively to preserve the effectiveness 
of antibiotics by:

- preventing infections
- optimising prescribing decisions using better diagnostics and epidemiological expertise
- promoting good practice in the management of infections.

A range of clinical guidelines are now available from various agencies which set out good practice and the latest 
evidence on hospital antimicrobial stewardship (see [Guidelines & toolkits](#guidelines--toolkits) section).


# What we already know

## Use of antimicrobials in hospitals

In the UK, hospitals are responsible for 20% of the total amount of antibiotics prescribed in humans. Compared with other health care environments, hospitals prescribe more broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are the drugs used for the most severe infections. 

UK hospitals have the second highest prescribing rate out of 22 European nations in number of doses per 1,000 resident ([ECDC 2017](#ECDC-TESSy2017)), and play a critical role in the acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in humans.

There are signs that antibiotics are being overused in hospitals:

- A survey of UK hospitals recently estimated that 17% days of therapy are avoidable ([Public Health England 2015](#PHE2015))
- A study in Oxford compared antibiotic use between general medical physicians and infection disease physicians, who are specialists in treating infections. The study found that infectious disease physicians used 30% less days of therapy ([Fawcett et al. 2016](#Fawcett2016))


## Effectiveness of stewardship interventions

Stewardship interventions in inpatient care settings are safe and effective in both: improving clinical practice, 
and reducing antimicrobial resistance. 
{:.lead}

The [most up-to-date and trusted systematic review](#Davey2017) of all evaluations published to date was released 
in 2017 in the Cochrane Library. Authors reviewed a total of 29 randomised controlled trials and 91 interrupted 
time series, and concluded that, overall, stewardship interventions are effective in relation to several outcomes:

- **compliance with clinical guidelines:** with intervention, 58% of patients were treated in accordance with antimicrobial guidelines, compared with 43% in a control group with no intervention
- **duration of antimicrobial therapy** was on average 2 days shorter with intervention
- **length of hospital stay** is an average 1 day shorter with intervention.

Authors also found no evidence that stewardship interventions increased mortality or other risks to patient safety.

Stewardship interventions also seem to reduce the prevalence of drug-resistant infections and transmission of drug-resistant bacteria. Baur et al. ([2017](#Baur2017)) analysed results from 32 observational and experimental studies and found:

- the incidence of *Clostridioides difficile* infections is reduced by 32%
- the incidence of multi-drug resistant Gram negative bacteria is halved
- the incidence of methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* is reduced by 37%.

Interventions that included hand hygiene promotion were also more effective that interventions that did not.

> **Glossary** 
> - Interrupted time series studies are observational clinical studies (unlike randomised controlled trials) which measure
 the impact of an intervention as it is introduced, by looking a change in the temporal trend in an outcome of interest.
- Clostridioides difficile*, also known as *C. difficile* or *C. diff*, is bacteria that can infect the bowel 
and cause diarrhoea. This infection is the most common side effect of antibiotics. It can spread easily to others 
and can put other vulnerable hospital patients at risk of serious harm.

## Implementation of stewardship interventions

Globally, antimicrobial stewardship programmes are now established in most hospitals in high-income countries. The degree to which they are operational and active has been investigated in several surveys. 

Howard et al. ([2015](#Howard2015)) surveyed 660 hospitals across a total of 67 countries. Fifty-eight percent of hospitals had a dedicated antimicrobial stewardship committee in place, with the highest proportion in North America and Europe (66%) and a very low proportion in Africa (14%).

This proportion ranged between 5 and 16% on other continents. Despite this, 62% of hospitals reported having established local stewardship guidelines

<!--	Chung GWW, Wu JEE, Yeo CLL, et al. Antimicrobial stewardship. Virulence 2013; 4: 151–157.-->

These surveys revealed that ASPs can be very demanding on health professionals’ time, skills and confidence.


In the UK, Scobie et al. ([2019](#Scobie2019)) conducted a survey of 148 NHS acute trusts in England in 2017. They found that 
<ul>
<li>85% restricted the use of some antibiotics by requiring a senior infection doctor or pharmacist to pre-authorise their prescription</li>
<li>93% had dedicated a dedicated antimicrobial stewardship team including at least an antimicrobial pharmacist and a microbiology/infectious diseases doctor</li>
<li>99% had hospital prescribing guidelines for common infections</li>
<li>82% had Review of courses or therapy for specific agents and feedback to prescribers by a Clinical Microbiologist/ ID specialist or Pharmacist </li>
</ul>

In 23% (34/148) of hospitals, stewardship ward rounds were conducted daily (including weekends) in one or more selected areas in the hospital, followed by three times weekly in 19%, twice weekly (6%) and weekly (1%). Regular stewardship ward rounds on ICU were conducted in most hospitals (99%, 146/148) most often daily on weekdays (47%). After ICU, the most common specialty ward rounds were in medicine (64%), followed by surgery (60%) and haematology (58%).

Evaluating the impact of stewardship programmes is more challenging. Hospital microbiology is a complex system, and the product of complex interactions of human behaviour (clinical decision making), microbiology (infection dynamics, development and spread of antibiotics resistance), and ???. Undertaking controlled experiments on a large scale is almost impossible. For that reason, most evaluations rely on observational data rather than experiments: for instance, examining the rate of antimicrobial use before and after an intervention is introduced. However, researchers and clinicians have been able to design and conduct experiments on a smaller scale (look at Davey).
Overall, this means

## Antibiotic prescription reviews

Antibiotic prescription reviews or ‘prospective audits’ involve the review of antibiotic prescriptions on wards by infection specialists, usually either an infectious diseases physician, a clinical microbiologist, or a clinical pharmacist. They are frequently described as the most effective strategy to optimise prescribing ([Chung et al. 2013](#Chung2013)).

Advantages of antibiotic prescription reviews are:

- they are more supportive and therefore better received by doctors than pre-authorisation of antibiotics. 
- they usually take places at the bedside (rather than over the telephone, when infection specialists cannot fully assess the patient); 
- they provides an opportunity for doctors to learn more about infections.

Disadvantages of antibiotic prescription reviews are:
-	They are time-consuming
-	They require up-to-date lists of patients taking antibiotics
-	Their reach can be limited by person-power: the median number of occupied beds in an English acute trust is 500. Out of those, 175 are occupied by patients taking antibiotics at any time. The median number of infection specialist is just 5 working time equivalents, occupied with many other duties.
-	Some areas of clinical practice are not supported by strong scientific evidence and guidelines. For instance, experts do not know for sure when and how antibiotics should be ‘de-escalated’; that is, how soon antibiotics can safely be stopped or changed for another drug with a narrower spectrum ([Hughes et al. 2017](#Hughes2017), [Tabah et al. 2019](#Tabah2019)).

# What questions did we ask?

## Review of published evidence

Although systematic reviews are available (see [above](#effectiveness-of-stewardship-interventions)), they only provide limited information as to the active ingredients of effective interventions.

In other words, we sought to understand what interventions components determine whether an intervention will be effective.

To this end, we obtained the list of 221 interventions reviewed as part of the recent Cochrane study by 
Davey et al. ([2017](#Davey2017)). Health psychologists read through every study report and coded for the presence of 
active ingredients of behavioural interventions, known as *behaviour change techniques* (BCTs). A statistician 
then analysed data on (a) intervention <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCTs</abbr> and (b) intervention 
effectiveness using a special technique testing for interactions.

## Electronic health records

As  of June 2019, over half of acute NHS Trusts operated an electronic prescribing and administration system, but these 
systems do not currently play a major role in stewardship programmes. We aimed to test whether and how electronic 
records of prescriptions, microbial samples, and patient investigations (blood counts, vital signs) could be used to 
identify where antimicrobial use could be rationalised.

Our study partner, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, anonymised and provided such records for adult inpatients admitted between 2008 and 2018. Researchers at University College London developed a range of software tools to visualise and analyse the data. The picture below shows a view from a prototype app used to audit the compliance of prescribing with the hospital’s antimicrobial prescribing guidelines.

## Electronic health records
We found that 
There is a delay in adopting new guidelines - for instance the pneumonia switch to amox rather than co-amox is not implemented by X% of teams two years after.
Can we see an effect in the change of coamox?

# Bringing it all together
We are currently working to synthesize what we have learnt and develop behaviour change interventions. This involves

- Reviewing barriers and facilitators of stewardship
- Identifying mechanisms of change and behaviour change techniques
- Collaborating with practitioners to decide how best to deliver behaviour change techniques in terms of feasibility and acceptability.
