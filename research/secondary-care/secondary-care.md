  Antimicrobial stewardship programmes in hospitals aim to optimise the use of antibiotics. Giving the right
   dose at the right time ensures infections are cured effectively, and that antibiotics are preserved for year to come.

## Stewardship in hospitals 
Antimicrobial stewardship programmes established in hospitals are a collaborative 
effort to prevent infections, optimise prescribing decisions using better diagnostics and 
epidemiological expertise, and promote good practice in the management of infections. 
Such programmes are usually multidisciplinary. They bring together medical professionals 
(in particular specialists in infectious disease and microbiology), pharmacists, surgeons, and 
infection control professionals.


## What is already known on the subject
Antimicrobial stewardship is, in many regards, a new field of expertise and of clinical leadership.
A range of [clinical guidelines]((#Resources.Guidelines)) is now available from various agencies which 
set out consensus on good practice and the latest evidence on hospital antimicrobial stewardship .
Many national or international [surveys](#Resources.Surveys) have monitored progress in 
implementing guidelines across hospitals.

### Effect of antimicrobial stewardship interventions
A systematic review of the effect stewardship interventions on mortality (Shuts [2016](#Schuts2016)) 
concluded that the most important objectives for stewardship programmes were: 
- empirical therapy regulated by locally-developed guidelines is associated with a 35% lower risk of death  
- de-escalation of therapy (stopping the prescription or changing to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic as soon as
   culture results are available) is associated with a 56% lower risk of death
- switching from parenteral to oral therapy as early as possible
- drug monitoring
- restriction of certain classes of antibiotics
- bedside audit by an infection specialist.

### Implementation
Hospital antimicrobial stewardship programmes are now established in most hospitals in high-income countries. Yet,
they can be very demanding on health professionals’ time, skills and confidence.

Howard *et al.* ([2015](#Howard2015)) found that... Examples. 

### Science

Intervention study designs do not follow the highest standards. The content and reporting of interventions fall 
short of behavioural science gold standards (Davey *et al.* [2015](#Davey2015)). As a result, it may be hard to 
interpret findings reported in scientific papers.

Stewardship interventions are difficult to evaluate. While benefits of interventions are evidenced in terms of
 survival, length of stay, reduction in antibiotics use, their effects on risks of resistance have not yet been 
 measured in  a pragmatic study (Morris [2014](#Morris2014)). Experts believe this is because hospital microbiology 
 is a complex system, with complex interactions between human behaviour (clinical decision making) and microbiology 
(infection dynamics, development and spread of antibiotics resistance).

Undertaking controlled experiments on a large scale in a hospital is extremely challenging due to requirements 
in staff resources, patient informed consent, randomisation overheads, etc. For that reason, the majority of evaluations 
relies on observational data rather than experiments: for instance, examining the rate of antimicrobial use before 
and after an intervention is introduced. 


## What questions did we ask?
### Electronic health records
In 2017, over a third of acute NHS Trusts operated an electronic prescribing and administration system (Department of Health [2018](DH2018)), 
but these systems do not currently play a major role in stewardship programmes. We aimed to test whether and how 
electronic records of prescriptions, microbial samples, and patient investigations (blood counts, vital signs) 
could be used to identify where antimicrobial use could be rationalised.

Our study partner, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, anonymised and provided such records for adult inpatients 
admitted between 2008 and 2018. Researchers at University College London developed a range of software tools to 
visualise and analyse the data. The picture below shows a view from a prototype app used to audit the compliance 
of prescribing with the hospital’s antimicrobial prescribing guidelines.
