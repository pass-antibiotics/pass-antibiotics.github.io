# Stewardship in hospitals 

The objectives of antimicrobial stewardship programmes are to work collaboratively to preserve the effectiveness 
of antibiotics by:

- preventing infections
- optimising prescribing decisions using better diagnostics and epidemiological expertise
- promoting good practice in the management of infections.

A range of clinical guidelines are now available from various agencies which set out good practice and the latest 
evidence on hospital antimicrobial stewardship (see [Guidelines & toolkits](#guidelines--toolkits) section).

# What we already know

## Use of antimicrobials in UK hospitals

In the UK, hospitals are responsible for 20% of the total amount of antibiotics prescribed in humans. Compared with other healthcare environments, hospitals prescribe more broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are the drugs used for the most severe infections. Hospitals can also play an important role in transmitting infections to other settings such as the community, for example when an individual with an active infection is discharged to a care home.

There are signs that antibiotics are being overused in hospitals:

- UK hospitals have the second highest prescribing rate out of 22 European nations in number of doses per 1,000 resident ([ECDC 2017](#ECDC-TESSy2017))
- A survey of UK hospitals recently estimated that 17% days of therapy are avoidable ([Public Health England 2015](#PHE2015))
- A study in Oxford compared antibiotic use between general medical physicians and infection disease physicians, who are specialists in treating infections. The study found that infectious disease physicians used 30% less days of therapy ([Fawcett et al. 2016](#Fawcett2016))

Worryingly, prescribing of the 'last resort' antibiotics (reserved for infections resistant to multiple drugs or patients with a compromised immune system) has increased by 28% between 2011 and 2016 ([Budd et al. 2019](#Budd2019)). These are mostly carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. 

Data show strong variation in the type of antibiotics used across hospitals. Specialist (eg cardiothoracic, haematology/oncology, paediatric  monospecialities) and teaching hospitals relied on large amounts of last-resort antibiotics.

## Effectiveness of stewardship interventions

Stewardship interventions in inpatient care settings are safe and effective in both: improving clinical practice, 
and reducing antimicrobial resistance. 
{:.lead}

The [most up-to-date and trusted systematic review](#Davey2017) of all evaluations published to date was released 
in 2017 in the Cochrane Library. Authors reviewed a total of 29 randomised controlled trials and 91 interrupted 
time series, and concluded that, overall, stewardship interventions are effective in relation to several outcomes:

- **compliance with clinical guidelines:** with intervention, 58% of patients were treated in accordance with antimicrobial guidelines, compared with 43% in a control group with no intervention
- **duration of antimicrobial therapy** was on average 2 days shorter with intervention
- **length of hospital stay** is an average 1 day shorter with intervention.

Authors also found no evidence that stewardship interventions increased mortality or other risks to patient safety.

A recent meta-analysis also provides some evidence that stewardship interventions reduce the prevalence of drug-resistant infections and transmission of drug-resistant bacteria. Baur et al. ([2017](#Baur2017)).


## Implementation of stewardship interventions globally

Globally, antimicrobial stewardship programmes are now established in most hospitals in high-income countries. 

Howard et al. ([2015](#Howard2015)) surveyed 660 hospitals across a total of 67 countries. Fifty-eight percent of hospitals had a dedicated antimicrobial stewardship committee in place, with the highest proportion in North America and Europe (66%) and a very low proportion in Africa (14%). This proportion ranged between 5 and 16% on other continents. 

Worldwide, 62% of hospitals reported having local stewardship guidelines.

The survey revealed that antimicrobial stewardship programmes can be very demanding on health professionals’ time, skills and confidence, particularly when it comes to reviewing antibiotic prescriptions ([Chung et al. 2013](#Chung2013)).

## Implementation of stewardship interventions in the UK

    <figcaption>Stewardship in secondary care: Common initiatives</figcaption>
</figure>


Scobie et al. ([2019](#Scobie2019)) surveyed stewardship initiatives across 148 NHS acute trusts in England in 2017. They found that 
<ul>
    <li><strong>85% restricted the use of some antibiotics</strong>, requiring a senior infection doctor or pharmacist to pre-authorise their prescription</li>
    <li><strong>93% had dedicated a dedicated antimicrobial stewardship team</strong>, including at least an antimicrobial pharmacist and a microbiology/infectious diseases doctor</li>
    <li><strong>99% had hospital prescribing guidelines</strong> for common infections</li>
    <li><strong>82% organised an expert review of prescriptions for specific antibiotics</strong>, with microbiology/infectious disease specialists or pharmacists giving feedback and advice to prescribers.</li>
</ul>

Half of hospitals (73/148) had a microbiologist conduct routine and regular ward rounds to review antibiotics at least once a week; 23% (34/148) did so every day (weekends included). The most commonly audited area was intensive care units (146/148), followed by medical wards (64%), surgical wards (60%) and haematology wards (58%).

Almost all hospitals were able to measure antimicrobial consumption, but only 31% (46/148) of surveyed hospitals regularly fed this information back to prescribers.


## Antibiotic prescription reviews

Antibiotic prescription reviews or ‘prospective audits’ involve the review of antibiotic prescriptions on wards by infection specialists, usually either an infectious diseases physician, a clinical microbiologist, or a clinical pharmacist. They are frequently described as the most effective strategy to optimise prescribing ([Chung et al. 2013](#Chung2013)).

Advantages of antibiotic prescription reviews are:

- they are more supportive and therefore better received by doctors than pre-authorisation of antibiotics. 
- they usually take places at the bedside (rather than over the telephone, when infection specialists cannot fully assess the patient); 
- they provides an opportunity for doctors to learn more about infections.

Disadvantages of antibiotic prescription reviews are:
-	They are time-consuming
-	They require up-to-date lists of patients taking antibiotics
-	Their reach can be limited by person-power: the median number of occupied beds in an English acute trust is 500. Out of those, 175 are occupied by patients taking antibiotics at any time. The median number of infection specialist is just 5 working time equivalents, occupied with many other duties.
-	Some areas of clinical practice are not supported by strong scientific evidence and guidelines. For instance, experts do not know for sure when and how antibiotics should be ‘de-escalated’; that is, how soon antibiotics can safely be stopped or changed for another drug with a narrower spectrum ([Hughes et al. 2017](#Hughes2017), [Tabah et al. 2019](#Tabah2019)).

# What questions did we ask?

## Review of published evidence

Although systematic reviews of stewardship interventions are available (see [above](#effectiveness-of-stewardship-interventions)), there is wide variation in the effectiveness of similar interventions across different settings. If we want to know which interventions are most likely to be effective, we need to know why they work.

In other words, we need to understand what are the 'active ingredients' of effective stewardship interventions. 

Behavioural science can be used to specify the 'active ingredients' of behavioural interventions, by coding them as [behaviour change techniques (BCTs)](https://digitalwellbeing.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BCTTv1_PDF_version.pdf){:target="_blank"}. To this end, health psychologists from PASS read through all 221 behavioural interventions reported in the systematic review by Davey et al. ([2017](#Davey2017)). They coded for the presence of <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s and then assessed how often effective interventions included specific types of <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s.  This provides evidence about the types of <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s that should be included in future stewardship interventions.

## Electronic health records

As  of June 2019, over half of acute NHS Trusts operated an electronic prescribing and administration system, but these 
systems do not currently play a major role in stewardship programmes. We aimed to test whether and how electronic 
records of prescriptions, microbial samples, and patient investigations (blood counts, vital signs) could be used to 
identify where antimicrobial use could be optimised.

Our study partner, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, provided the study team with anonymised patient records for adults who were admitted to hospital between 2008 and 2018. Researchers at University College London developed a range of software tools to visualise and analyse the data. The picture below shows a view from a prototype app used to compare compliance of antibiotic prescribing against the hospital’s stewardship guidelines.

## Interviews of prescribers

The aim of the interviews was to understand who performs antibiotic reviews, as well as when and how decisions to switch from intravenous to oral therapy and to stop antibiotics are made as part of antibiotic stewardship. The interview questions were developed using a theoretical informed behaviour change framework to identify the likely enablers and barriers of conducting reviews of antibiotics and switching or stopping antibiotic prescriptions (Atkins et al [2017](#Atkins2017)). Interviews took place in an NHS Foundation Trust hospital in England within low and high prescribing wards. Interviews were conducted with consultants, registrars, junior doctors and pharmacists across 4 specialist wards.

## Observations

An ethnographer conducted non-participant observation at an NHS Foundation Trust hospital in England. Four consultant teams were drawn at random from hospital databases based on their record of prescribing. The researcher observed a total of four wards during a total of 123 hours.

The researcher recorded detailed hand written field notes while at the research site. The researcher reflected on these notes and audio recorded the field notes, reflections and interpretations. These audio recordings were then transcribed and analysed alongside pictures and policies/guidelines collected from the research site.

Data were analysed using a qualitative data analysis software by coding contextual determinants of healthcare improvement. This was based on a framework of six universal challenges to improving quality commonly faced by healthcare organisation and identified by Bate, Mendel and Robert [(2008)](#Bate2018).

# What did we find?

## Review of published evidence

Interventions delivered in hospital inpatient settings employed 29 out of a total of [93 behaviour change techniques](https://digitalwellbeing.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/BCTTv1_PDF_version.pdf){:target="_blank"} (<abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s), highlighting that many <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s are not used at all. 

The average number of <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s in each intervention was 4.5, 
showing that interventions are designed as a complex combination of techniques. 

The five most common <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s were:

{% include_relative bct_cards_html.html %}
 
However, when analysing the effect of individual <abbr title="behaviour change techniques">BCT</abbr>s on intervention 
effectiveness, the statistical analysis only detected one interaction: interventions with <abbr title="behaviour change 
technique">BCT</abbr> *(1.2) Problem solving* were more effective than other interventions. Problem solving consists 
in analysing, or prompting the person to analyse, factors influencing their prescribing and bringing forward strategies 
to overcome barriers to improve prescribing.

## Bringing it all together

As a team, we then reviewed the research as a whole. Across findings from the electronic health records research,
clinician interviews, ward observations and design workshops, we looked for links or disagreements between individual
findings, and patterns emerging between groups of findings.

This helped us to better understand the key barriers to good antibiotic stewardship in secondary care, 
what changes needed to take place in this setting, and where we should focus our intervention design work. 

As a team, we identified 6 priority areas for strengthening antibiotic stewardship in secondary care:
   
1. Keeping clinicians up to date with patient tests are being done and what the results are;
2. Providing all the right information about a patient and their illness in real time, so that a clinician can decide whether their prescriptions are right;
3. Supporting wards and clinicians to make sure antibiotics are reviewed in a timely manner;
4. Providing better feedback to wards on how they usually prescribe, and letting clinicians know if they are prescribing appropriately or not;
5. Finding ways to make sure the right kinds of information about patients and prescribing decisions are collected throughout their stay, to support clinicians to complete reviews when they need to;
6. Building more specific prescribing guidelines that help clinicians to know when it is safe to stop or switch a patient’s antibiotic, and what their options are for doing this.

We plan to develop three intervention bundles, that together would start to address 
these 6 priority areas.

## Intervention bundle 1

### Patient Infection Timeline

**What is it?** When clinicians review antibiotics, they need easy access to lots of information about the patient to check if 
the prescription they have been given is right, or need adjusting. They need to see if they have understood the
 patient's potential infection correctly by looking at:
 
- the patient's medical history: chronic conditions, past infections,
- records of allergies to certain antibiotics
- past and current antibiotics prescribed
- results of tests investigating what the infection might be and whether it is caused by bacteria
- markers of how the patient is responding to antibiotics already prescribed, such as temperature, C-reactive protein
 and while cell blood counts.

This is information is particularly important for microbiologists who are not part of the day-to-day care 
team and are reviewing the patient for the very first time. The way that electronic health systems are 
currently built mean that it is not easy to access all this information at once. 

**How does it work?** We are designing a web-based Patient Infection Timeline displaying all information
 clinicians need to initiate or review antibiotic prescriptions. The Timeline draws information from hospital
  electronic health records and displays a chronological view of what has happened to the patient in relation to
   infections and how their state has changed since they arrived in hospital.

The screenshot below shows how the timeline might be structured and what we think it needs to contain.

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/img/research/secondary-care/infection_timeline.png" class="lead"/>
    <figcaption>Prototype of the proposed Patient Infection Timeline, designed to be built into hospital electronic
     medical record systems</figcaption>
</figure>

The timeline is continously updated with new information inputted into the electronic medical records during the
 hospital stay. The Timeline displays the same information to all staff, independently of their role: this is to
  support good communication and shared learning because everyone is on the same page about what's happening 
  with the patient.

**Who does it support, and when?** The Timeline is aimed at all clinicians who review antibiotic prescriptions:

- junior and senior doctors on hospital wards
- pharmacists and infectious diseases clinicians on or away from wards
- microbiologists based in labs or doing outreach in wards.

The Timeline helps these clinicians review all information relevant to diagnosing and treating a potential
 infection. This may be:
  
- at the start of a hospital stay, to learn about a patient's history of infection and resistance to antibiotics
- later during the hospital stay, for instance when doctors external to the main clinical team come and review the
 patient to give an opinion on the best course of action.
 
Seeing all this information together helps clinicians decide whether they should stop an antibiotic early 
or switch to a less risky one, where it is safe to do so. By doing this they will reduce patients’ exposure 
to antibiotics and any risks of developing antibiotic resistance. 

**What else is needed?** Clinicians would also need to record all antibiotic decisions made during the hospitalisation
(reasons for prescribing, rationale for any subsequent adjustments to the prescription) in a structured way, so it
can be displayed on the timeline. The ARK hospital approach (Cross *et al.* [2019](#Cross2019)) sets out a range
of principles for capturing the justification for prescribing and the prescriber's level of certainty.

Clinicians at every level also need to be up to date on local patterns of antibiotic resistance in the hospital, 
and key ways to safely keep patients on minimum antibiotics. For this, they need training, shared learning, and easy 
access to [relevant prescribing guidelines](#intervention-bundle-3).
                                                                                                                               to help clinicians optimise therapy. 
PASS research also shows we need ways to support hospital ward teams to 

1. decide who is responsible for doing reviews
2. problem-solve what might prevent reviews being completed
3. work out the earliest point reviews should be happening on their ward. 


**Where have we got to?** Our research told us what information the Timeline should
 visualise or provide access to, including what parts should be grouped together and in what form. We presented a draft visual of this to hospital 
clinicians, who told us what else would need to be included, or what would need to change to support them best 
to complete a review. 

Using this feedback we then built a clickable prototype of the Timeline. Doing this helped us to check what each 
of its parts should achieve and how these parts should work, both alone and all together. With help from researchers 
and clinicians on the team we invented a patient story and uploaded their simulated data into the prototype. 
This allowed us to test the Timeline with clinicians outside the PASS team, to see how well it supported them 
to complete an antibiotic review. 

**What do clinicians think about it?** include bullet point / summary of…

- clinicians feedback
- their perceived benefits of the Timeline 
- clinician quotes to back this up 


### Recording symptoms of urinary tract infections

**What is it?** Our research told us that ongoing information about a patient’s symptoms (and how these change 
throughout their hospital stay) is very useful for clinicians when they antibiotic prescriptions. 

However, symptoms are not recorded regularly or systematically enough. This is in spite of many different staff who
 regularly come into contact with the patient being able to capture a range of symptoms relevant to their expertise. 

Using urinary tract infections (UTI) as a starting point, we asked clinicians:

- what kinds of symptom information should be collected? 
- how should this information be organised and presented to help diagnose urinary tract infections or review any
 antibiotics being prescribed to treat it?

Besides having access to basic information about the patient such as age, gender, how well their organs work, 
and any long term conditions related to urinary tract infections, our research suggests the following
 information would be helpful:

- patient vitals (temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation)
- regular assessments of the patient's cognition, frailty, and mobility through the thospital stay
- primary symptoms of urinary tract infections: pain, frequency and urgency to urinate, new incontinence, vomiting
- secondary symptoms such as urine colour and cloudiness.

Our engagement with clinicians also suggests hospital staff should categorise records of symptoms as:

- objective observations: information that is clearly defined and often captured as a number
- subjective observations: information that is usually gathered through asking a patient questions
- impression of the patient as a whole (is their illness improving or getting worse?)

**What else is needed?** To support the efficient recording of patient symptoms, we also need:

- to recording symptoms well at admission as this creates a baseline against which clinicians can note any symptom
 changes more easily
- to support all staff in contact with the patient in recording symptoms according to their expertise (e.g
. physiotherapists are able to assess and score patient frailty)
- to support wards in deciding who should be capturing symptoms and how often.

**Where have we got to?** We identified two possible routes for intervention design that would work towards supporting better symptoms capture:

1. to build and expand on existing symptom capture templates (such as nurse paper charts), supported by clear
 instructions on when and how to record symptoms
2. to develop a symptoms capture app, using the challenge of supporting diagnosis of UTI as a starting
 point.
 
To be successful, both routes would need to incorporate plans for individual staff training, and be 
supported by additional team-wide interventions that help wards to capture symptoms regularly, 
systematically and in a timely manner.

## Intervention bundle 2

### Antibiotic surveillance system

**What is it?** An antibiotic surveillance system is a computer algorithm designed to monitor electronic health
records of hospital inpatients taking antibiotics. The algorithm has access to the patient's latest test results in
real-time, and is trained against expert clinicians to predict when antibiotic prescriptions should be changed. 
The system shows infection experts (microbiologists and pharmacists) a prioritised list of the patients who are 
most likely to benefit from being reviewed immediately, alongside their location in the hospital.
That way, infection specialists working outside the patient's usual care team can come in and provide advice to
doctors when they need it, without having to review every single patient in the hospital.

**What difference will it make?** The average hospital in England has 150 inpatients on antibiotics at any point, and
 employs just 8 infection specialists, many of whom work in laboratories and analyse patient samples. This means they
have limited time and person-power available to help on the wards, despite being the most knowledgeable experts in
 antibiotics and infections. Giving them access to a real-time list of patients needing a prescription review will
 reduce the amount of time they need to dedicate in order to change prescriptions. Our research suggests that at
  least 20% of inpatients (a total of 30 patients out of 150 in the average hospital) need a change of prescription,
and infection specialist need 12 minutes to review one patient. Even with moderate predictive capability, we estimate
that by reviewing just 20 patients at the top of the prioritisation list, infection specialists are likely to find 14
 out of the 30 patients needing a change of prescription. In just one clinic session, they can thus potentially
  address 47% of antibiotics needing a change, compared to just 13% using the current approach.
 
**What else is needed?** In addition to building and deploying the software in hospitals, we need a greater
 proportion of hospitals to adopt electronic prescribing and prescribing system. In 2020, we estimate that just over
  50% of English hospitals have such systems. The Departments of Health across the UK are aiming to bring such
   systems to all hospitals by 2025. The predictive power of the algorithm will also be dependent on clinicians
    inputting clinical observations and test results as and when they become available into their electronic medical
     records system, so that the algorithm has access to the latest information.

**What do clinicians think about it?** We have worked with infectious disease consultants and pharmacists on the
 design of this intervention bundle. They are enthusiastic about the potential to save time and focus on patient care
 more than they are currently able to. They noted this will modify the relationship they have with frontline
 clinicians: at the moment, ward clinicians need to phone infection specialists for advice, or there needs to be an
 agreement that specialists review all patients in a ward on a regular basis. With the prioritisation list, there will 
 now be an additional way in which specialists will engage with the wards.

**How far have we got?** We are soon going to pilot this approach in a large hospital in London to demonstrate that
 the algorithm is as precise as we need it to be to help clinicians. If this pilot is successful, we will apply for
  funding to fully develop and trial this system across several hospitals in the UK.



### Audit & Feedback




## Intervention bundle 3

Supporting de-escalation of antibiotic therapy

Existing guidelines usually suggest a class and
  dose of antibiotic, but they may not always advise when and how to change or stop antibiotics. Due to this, 
  future research should gather health experts to build new guidelines that will better guide clinicians in 
  adapting antibiotic treatments in a more responsive and timely way, and do not extend the treatment beyond 
   beyond
